## CDN Network Block List

This is a best-effort list of network blocks for various CDNs (Akamai, Cloudflare)

## Supernetting

These are *not* supernetted, so that each block can be individually checked later on in case ownership changes. This means there may be overlaps/duplicates. This isn't a problem since the purpose of these lists is simply to blacklist
